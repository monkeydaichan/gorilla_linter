# gorilla_linter

A highly sophisticated linter for Flutter apps.

Added a rule for flutter_lints that I think is even better.

## Install

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  gorilla_linter: any
```

## Linters

- avoid_using_hardcoded_strings  
  Avoid using hardcoded strings in Text widgets. Use i18n or similar internationalization techniques instead.
- avoid_using_return_string_literal
  Avoid using to return strings. Use i18n or similar internationalization techniques instead.
